// Pure functions are another core concept of functional programming. They will make
// your life much easier because they will not affect your applicationâ€™s state. When writing functions, try to follow these three rules:
// 1. The function should take in at least one argument.
// 2. The function should return a value or another function.
// 3. The function should not change or mutate any of its arguments.
